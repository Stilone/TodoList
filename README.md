## Description:
List of Project Portfolio tasks
Every respectable programmer should have at least one project from the to-do list in their portfolio, and surprisingly, it took me some time to get to it. However, when faced with a test task that requires making a to-do list, I found a great opportunity to delve into this important project. The task presented itself in the form of a Figma design, and, to my surprise, the result was more than satisfactory.

key functions
Task Management: Create and delete tasks effortlessly, providing a fundamental tool for organizing daily activities.

Server Integration: Extract and synchronize tasks with the server, ensuring seamless access and consistency of data across devices.

Implementation of the Figma design: The Figma design was used as the basis, demonstrating the ability to bring the designer's vision to life in a functional application.

Reflection
This to-do list project is not only a practical implementation of task management, but also evidence of continuous learning. Despite the fact that the recruiter did not provide feedback, I continued to study and look for my first job.

Feel free to explore the codebase and leave feedback or suggestions. After all, every project is an opportunity to learn and grow. Forward and higher! 🚀
